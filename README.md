# Sign-In-Program
Various quality of life applets I've made for units around the base.  The Security Office Sign-In program was made so students visiting the security office here can sign up for various out-processing appointments.  Made it easier for the security office personnel to track students and maintain accountability.

# Appointment Scheduler
The Legal Office Sign-In program is actually an appointment scheduler used by the legal office here on base to keep track of when appointments are taking place and if they can take that appointment at that certain time and date.
